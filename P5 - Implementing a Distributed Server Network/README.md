Final Semester Project, Implementing a Distributed Server Network

Created a distributed network based on a heavily modified version of the Internet Relay Chat protocol. 
Building on your previous knowledge, this project will introduce 
1) how to use selectors to support simultaneous, non-blocking processing of multiple sockets
2) how to implement a distributed network capable of maintaining a shared state across all machines in the network.
